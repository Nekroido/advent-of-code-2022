    "The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a tree house.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house **hidden**. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are **visible from outside the grid** when looking directly along a row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves have already launched a quadcopter to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:\n",

    "65332\n",
    "33549\n",
    "35390\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where `0` is the shortest and `9` is the tallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is **visible** if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are **shorter** than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the trees around the edge of the grid are **visible** - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top-left `5` is **visible** from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height `5` are in the way.)\n",
    "- The top-middle `5` is **visible** from the top and right.\n",
    "- The top-right `1` is **not visible** from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height `0` between it and an edge.\n",
    "- The left-middle 5 is **visible**, but only from the right.\n",
    "- The center `3` is **not visible** from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height `2` between it and an edge.\n",
    "- The right-middle `3` is **visible** from the right.\n",
    "- In the bottom row, the middle `5` is **visible**, but the `3` and `4` are **not**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of `21` trees are visible in this arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider your map; **how many trees are visible from outside the grid?**"
